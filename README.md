This project was implemented for an Apriorit's site article to demonstrate how to implement Kerberos authentication via using the System API. 
There are unit-tests that allow you to study using of System API in debugging. 
In order to study Kerberos Authentication and not to configure a specific environment in the debugging, we specifically did not implement the following functionality (instead it we used mock functionality):
    1) Client-server communication (sending messages to client/server, receiving messages from client/server).
    2) Parse the messages from client/server.
    3) Pack the message into a request/response.
The main goal of the KerberosSkeleton project is:
    1) Code demonstration for the Apriorit's site article.
    2) Ability to learn the implementation of Kerberos Authentication via debug.
    3) Provide you the kerberos skeleton project for your future Kerberos Authentication projects.
